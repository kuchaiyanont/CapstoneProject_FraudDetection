# Conclusion

1. Fraudulent transactions spend a little money but many times.

2. The transaction with product C, Discover card, credit card, Microsoft email and use a mobile have more probable to be a fraudulent transactions.

3. The best model to predict probability of fraud or not fraud for this data set is Gradient Boosting.

4. Each company has the different criteria to detect fraud so, we can adjust the suitable threshold from the modelâ€™s prediction.
